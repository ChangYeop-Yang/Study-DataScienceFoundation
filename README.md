## ★ Project Outline
There are many kinds of big data. Among them, sensor data are most widely used and are in the
limelight in the fourth industry. Therefore, we decided to collect data on the environment
(temperature, illumination, air quality, noise) at home through the Arduino to get indirect
experience of the fourth industry. In addition to this, to give an example of the classification of
big data, we have added a topic that can analyze the most popular car models in a given area by
collecting car models and location data when a car is taken with a mobile application.
